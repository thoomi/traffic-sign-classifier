Overview
---
This is the second project I am doing as part of Udacity's Self-Driving-Car Nanodegree. After learning the theoretical concepts of *neural networks* and *deep learning* I started exploring [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Following that path I used the newly gained knowledge to build up a *deep neural network* in order to recognize 43 different German traffic signs. Utilizing different preprocessing and data augmentation techniques my final model got an accuracy of **98.6%** on the validation set and an accuracy of **96.0%** on the test set.
